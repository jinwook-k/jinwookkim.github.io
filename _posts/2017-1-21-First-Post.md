## Introduction
Greetings! My name is Jinwook Kim and I am a senior at the University of Texas at Austin. I am currently pursuing a BSA in Computer Science with a minor in Chinese. I personally love the arts and was estatic when the CS department released a new degree plan that included the arts even more. I have already taken 4 semester of Chinese, taking my second semester of Japanese right now, and next week I am about to start my first day learning Vietnamese through the Asian American Resources Center (so, it is not affiliated with UT; just taking it for fun). 

My hobbies are folding origami, making cosplay costumes, and independent studies on learning new tools in programming. I'm not the best programmer, but I sure do love this field! CS is so broad that I think I'll never get bored! I'm the type that'll get bored doing the same thing over and over and over again... 

I'm super excited to learn in this class and to code a lot! I am also interested in going the cyber security route.

### What did I do this past week?
This past week I spent some time starting up this blog by using Jekyll, and reading through the articles and books assigned to us for this class. 

### What's in my way?
The main thing that I'm kind of worried about of what is going to be my biggest obstacle in this class is the amount of different tools we are using. First, it seems very overwhelming, but in my mindset, I just want to get my hands dirty and use them already so I'm not constantly anxious about not knowing what the tools do. Once we start using the tools, I feel like most of my anxiety will go away. 

### What will I do next week? 
I am going to constantly try to stay on top of this class by keeping up with the assignments, trying to quiz myself every time I read for the assignments to prepare myself for the daily quizzes, and work on the big projects day by day so it does not haunt me on the day it is due. 

So far, I am liking the class a lot. Very engaging in a way that we're looking through code of what it does, the progress of developing code, and the fear of being called on always keeps me on edge to be paying attention. 

We had our first daily quiz and it was fine. For some reason it didn't work on my phone, so I had to use my laptop, but after the quiz, one of my friends mentioned that you have to use the browser through Canvas to see the quiz, not the Canvas app itself. 

## TIP-OF-THE-WEEK
Here are all the websites I used to make this blog (it also include how to set up this blog in windows since I was too lazy to do it in Linux). It also includes how to connect your Google Domain to GitHub Pages.
